                <h3>South Afrika</h3>
                <p>Sitting on Africa&apos;s tip, the Rainbow Nation really lives up to its name. Some countries get just deserts, while others get only grasslands not South Africa. Here, Mother Nature stepped it up a notch, conjuring up lace-white beaches, vast vineyards and biscuit-coloured savannahs. And with a landmass about five times that of Britain, it&apos;s near-impossible to get bored. With South Africa&apos;s lively cities and show stopping wildlife, you won&apos;t know where to begin. </p>

                <h3>India</h3>
                <p>Whether you&apos;re lazing on palm fringed sands, exploring atmospheric temples or haggling for a bargain at a street market, holidays to India are packed with unforgettable experiences. A mere mention of India is enough to conjure up a hint of spice, a flash of colour, and a whiff of excitement. Make no mistake about it - this place doesn&apos;t so much as stir the senses as launch an all-out assault on them.</p>

                <h3>Morocco</h3>
                <p>Offering a scenic coastline and one of Africa&apos;s most sought after cities, holidays to Morocco give Europe&apos;s top tourist destinations a run for their money. Morocco&apos;s introduction to the mainstream holiday market in the late Nineties added a new genre to the library of world travel. Suddenly, holidays were scented with spice rather than suncream, and the soundtrack of waves was remixed with calls to prayer. Our holidays take you to the blush-coloured Marrakech and the Atlas Mountains.</p>

                <h3>Montenegro</h3>
                <p>Beautiful beaches, lively resorts and spectacular scenery you&apos;ll find them all on a holiday to Montenegro, Europe&apos;s under the radar spot. With great beaches, forest cloaked mountains and mirror like lakes, Montenegro is certainly easy on the eye. But natural beauty isn&apos;t all the country has got going for it. You&apos;ll also find friendly locals, centuries old sights and resorts that are completely geared up for holidaymakers. This holiday is perfect for a calm and relaxing vacation.</p>

                <h3>Mexico</h3>
                <p>Mexico&apos;s the glue that links the North and South American continents together. The country&apos;s two million square kilometres pack in everything from mega cities and tiny pueblo towns to jungles and Mayan relics. But, for holidaymakers at least, the coastal areas hold the main appeal - from the luxe hotels of Los Cabos to the country&apos;s nightlife capital, Cancun. And with sun beaming down throughout the year, there&apos;s never a bad time to visit.</p>

                <h3>Egypt</h3>
                <p>In the race for the title of the world&apos;s top holiday destination, Egypt runs with the elite more than 12 million tourists flock here every year. Today visitors come for nightlife but also the amazing sun and beaches. Hurghada and Sharm El Shiekh dip their toes in the clear waters of the Red Sea. Expect white beaches that stretch out like party streamers, some of the world&apos;s best scuba sites, and every water sport you can think of.</p>
